Reviewâ€˜s comments on Towards Evaluating the Effectiveness of Botnet Detection Techniques:
  The entry point of this paper is very original, try to address the potential weaknesses of BotMiner on IoT-based botnets. This is a carefully done study and the findings are of considerable interest.  A few minor revisions are listed below.
  The paper was to assess the capabilities of the traditional botnet detection technique BotMiner when applied on IoT-based botnets, while also validating a reconstruction thereof. This paper begins with a detailed description of Botnets(i.e Section 2) and BotMiner(i.e Section 3).The paper is a very detailed analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of BotMiner, however, the description of Equation 1 in Section 3 is not clear enough and can be described in more detail.
  In the experimental section, this paper also states more clearly the purpose of the experiment, one is to determine the advantages of BotMiner when applied to hosts infected as IoT-based botnets, and the other is to ensure that BotMiner's reconstruction can faithfully perform its original function of successfully detecting infected hosts on traditional networks, especially when the number of bots is greater than one. The table of experimental results is also very clear, but it is suggested that some graphs can be used to show the results of the experiment, and the table is not intuitive enough to read clearly.
  In the final results and conclusions section, the paper summarizes more clearly the effectiveness and shortcomings of BotMiner in detecting botnets in IoT and also looks at future cutting-edge technologies for botnet detection in the IoT domain.
  Overall, this paper requires a little work to be in a publishable state. The final recommendation for this paper is to accept.
